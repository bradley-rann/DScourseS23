\section{Part 1}
I'm interested in scraping data from two main sources really. First, I would like to sparse professional tennis data and track how well American players are doing (they've been poor since Andy Roddick but a youngish generation has started to climb the ranks). I would also like to scrape data that would relate to health, whether it's epidemiological or clinical data about certain treatments or something I could apply to health economics.

\section{Part 2}

The results of class(df1) and class(df2) are as follows:
class(df1)
tbl\_df,tbl,data.frame
class(df)
"tbl\_spark" "tbl\_sql"   "tbl\_lazy"  "tbl"

The column names are different because df1 is created only in tidyverse whereas df is a copy of it in spark so it's added different languages and functions like SQL.
